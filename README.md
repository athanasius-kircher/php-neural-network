# Sample implementation of a neural network in PHP

This illustrates a basic implementation of a neural network as base for machine learning. 
Currently only the basic concepts are implemented.

PHP is not the most suited language to achieve that as in contrast to python it misses some algebra function in the language core.

## Run
- Use ddev
- Then use the command interface to train the model or ask it
  - Mint based datasets required
- Also includes a small web gui to allow draw on a canvas and let the system guess the drawn number based on the training data
